        <p>Create a number of views in this view control of size 50x50 that move when you touch them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The views should be added by clicking a button and start at a random location on the screen that does not overlap any other view on the screen.</li>
            <li>Each time any of the views are touched the view should move to a new location and not overlap any other view on the screen.</li>
            <li>There should be a number inside each view that shows the number of times that view has been touched.</li>
            <li>The views bounds should always be within the screen area (both landscape and portrait should be tested).</li>
            <li>Animate the views to their new location.</li>
            <li>Give the views some <i>style</i>.</li>
